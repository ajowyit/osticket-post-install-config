<p>
  - For osTicket there two main URLs that we will use for this project and the next one.
</p>
<p>
  - http://localhost/osTicket/scp - Your Staff Control Panel. This is used by Admins and the Help Desk Agents. </p>
<p>
  - Bookmark this page in the VM's browser. Name it something like: "osTicket Agent Portal"
</p>
<p>
  - http://localhost/osTicket.com - Your osTicket URL. This is for end users to create tickets and check ticket status.
</p>
<p>
  - Bookmark this page in the VM's browser. Name it something like: "osTicket Support Center Portal"
</p>

</p>
<p>
  - Log in on the Staff Control Panel. Remeber from the previous porject that username is adminuser and password is Password1.

<p>
  - Once logged into the Staff Control Panel URL, there are two different panels that can be used depending on your permissions, Admin Panel and Agent Panel.
</p>
<p>
  - Admin Panel - Used by the System Admin to confiured settings on the backend. 
</p>
<p>
  - Agent Panel - Used by the Help Desk Agents or Support Specialists to view and work tickets.
</p>
<p>
  - As an Admin, you can switch panels by clicking the panel name on the top right of the screen. We will jump between the two a lot throughout the project. Lets get started.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This concludes our project. We have successfully completed the post-install configurations for osTicket. We will put our settings to the test in the next lab when we create and work tickets as a User, Agent, and Admin. Don't forget to Stop (turn off) the VMs in Azure. As always, Thank You for your time and viewing this Project. We'll see you on the next one! üòé
